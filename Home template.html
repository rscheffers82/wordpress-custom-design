  <h3 class="thin center">Hi, I’m Julie.</h3>

  I’m a life coach, mentor coach and intuitive consultant committed to helping you feel inspired about who you are and the positive impacts you want to make. I help leaders and creative individuals trust their intuition to make better decisions, gain clarity and lead with meaning and purpose.</strong>

  I know the path can feel solitary and fraught with uncertainty. It can raise our fears and self-doubt and attract lots of external 'noise' (voices telling us how it should be), but together we can turn down the volume on this.

  I am here to walk alongside you and support you in revving up your courage and strength to be who you are fully, completely and unapologetically. I am here to help you trust in yourself and your own best answers so that you can do the work you are meant to do and make the positive impacts that are yours to uniquely make.

  I have spent hundreds of hours coaching individuals from all over the world for the last 10 years and have created a successful online radio show featuring hours of conversations with thought leaders in our world today. My commitment is driven by the desire to assist individuals in honoring themselves and the world in which we live. We can best serve the world when we first serve ourselves.

  I invite you to take the time now to really honor and deeply listen to yourself. This is the way you can be the force that enriches your life and those around you, at a time when we seem to need it most.
